Pacquiao officially hangs up his gloves				




The curtain has been drawn on one of boxing’s finest careers as boxing legend Manny “Pacman” Pacquiao announced that he is officially hanging up his gloves.



“I just heard the final bell. Boxing is over. I never thought this day would come as I hang up my boxing gloves.” said an emotional Pacquiao in a video shared on his social media accounts.














One of the most inspiring rags-to-riches stories, Pacquiao expressed his gratitude to the sport that changed his life.



“Goodbye, boxing. Thank you for changing my life. My family was desperate, you gave us hope. You give me the chance to fight our way out of poverty. Because of you, I was able to inspire people all over the world.”



Pacquiao steps away from his 26-year, 72-fight career with 62 wins, eight losses and two draws. Of those 62 wins, 39 were by knockout and 23 by decision. He is the only eight-division world champion in boxing history.



The sport’s “pound-for-pound king” also paid special tribute to his long-time trainer Freddie Roach who he described as “my family, a brother and a friend”.



His retirement from boxing followed a disheartening defeat to Yordenis Ugas in Paradise, Nevada on 21 August. 



Pacquiao will now turn his attention to his political career, where he has been nominated as a potential successor to current President Rodrigo Duterte.
