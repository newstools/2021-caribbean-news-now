Commentary: Vaccine mandates and a changing Barbados?				




by Renaldo Weekes BSc



The Barbados government has started to administer the Pfizer vaccine doses it received from the United States on August 13. Last weekend, Dr Elizabeth Ferdinand remarked that over 1,100 persons were vaccinated in just two days and most of those persons opted to take the Pfizer vaccine. 



Previously, officials were continually urging persons to come forward for vaccinations and now it seems that persons have answered their call. So, then, what is the difference? The answer was mentioned earlier. The Pfizer vaccine. Before the arrival of Pfizer, Sinopharm was the vaccine of choice. Many persons do not trust the Sinopharm vaccine from China. Even officials in other countries would not recognize persons as vaccinated if they have the Sinophram vaccine. 



For persons who enjoy travelling, this would create quite the dilemma since they would technically be vaccinated but would not be recognized as vaccinated. It is very easy to label those who are against mandatory vaccines, especially those that participated in the march a few weeks ago on August 7, 2021, as anti-vax persons.



 However, considering the turnout for vaccinations for Pfizer, it is clear to see that some of those against mandatory vaccination were persons who probably did not want to be forced to take certain vaccines; and with the arrival of more AstraZeneca doses, vaccination numbers may continue to increase exponentially. 



Additionally, the fight against mandatory vaccines and vaccine passport policies was also about fundamental rights and freedoms. 



As social activist Winston Clarke noted, “We are neither anti-vaccine nor are we anti-government. This is about freedom, freedom of choice, freedom of conscience, the freedom to do what you want to do with your body [and] the freedom to practice your religious rights and the freedom as human beings to refuse non-consensual treatment in any form.” 



To some persons, it seems as though that officials were willing to twist the hands of citizens to the point of taking away citizens’ right to live freely. The aforementioned vaccine passports may also work to exacerbate existing inequality by essentially affording certain privileges to only a certain section of the population. 



The government has made clear that they are against mandatory vaccines and would not require persons to pay for PCR tests unless they are travelling. 



However, with one hotel already declaring that all staff and visitors must be vaccinated, one must wonder what other business will declare their hand. Additionally, how would citizens square the government’s claims that persons have a choice with the fact that the same government considered policies to essentially twist their citizens’ arms into taking the vaccine? 



I think more than anything, citizens are afraid that what they consider heavy-handedness on the part of the government may be extended beyond covid vaccines.



If they let the government slip now, would they try another heavy-handed policy in another scenario? Some persons are already wary of our change to a republic. Though some of the wariness may be due to misunderstanding what that change means, citizens are more attentive to what they perceive as threats to their freedom. 



Bajans have always been described as a docile bunch and though we would have our complaints, we wouldn’t protest or riot as is the habit of citizens in other countries. However, the vaccine issue may have changed that. Will this mark a sea change in Bajans’ behaviour or is it just a passing trend? 



Some persons have opined that we are simply following the lead of persons in other countries. If the issue was specific to Barbados and not seen in other places, would we have the same energy? There’d be no one else to influence us in that scenario. It remains to be seen what would happen in the future if another issue rears its head.



Maybe Bajans have become more tuned in to their civil liberties and would be more willing to defend them. Maybe we are only following a trend. Whatever the case, we should keep our eyes open to what may very well be a shift in how citizens view their government and how they will react to perceived threats to their liberties.
