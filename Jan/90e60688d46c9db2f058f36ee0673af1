Jamaica to improve capacity of labs for COVID-19 tests				




The Ministry of Industry, Investment and Commerce of Jamaica is working along with the Ministry of Health & Wellness to improve the capacity of local laboratories to undertake coronavirus (COVID-19) tests and clamp down on unauthorised facilities.



In a press briefing, Portfolio Minister, Hon. Audley Shaw, said that as part of the process, private laboratories will be assisted to secure accreditation through the proper channels, in order to ensure that testing standards are equivalent to those of government facilities.



“We have noted the recent reports of the burgeoning COVID-19 testing market and have also heard the calls of the Minister of Health & Wellness for greater support and collaboration towards improving the Government’s response to the pandemic.”



In response, Shaw said that the Jamaica National Agency for Accreditation (JANAAC) was tasked to fast-track the accreditation of private entities desirous of providing COVID-19 tests. 



“Through JANAAC, the Ministry is outlining its support to our local laboratories and other facilities to ensure Jamaica can ramp up its systems and support capabilities in support of the clarion call to boost the nation’s ability to keep pace with developments in the global community.”



Targeted are private laboratories and point-of-care testing facilities such as doctors’ offices, health centres and pharmacies.



JANAAC will also be subsidising some of the costs associated with the accreditation process.



The minister emphasized that accrediting these testing facilities plays a critical role in safeguarding the local tourism industry, in light of requirements by the major tourism partners for travellers to their jurisdictions, including citizens returning from a vacation overseas, to provide a negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test.



The requirement has led to increased demand for testing for the virus locally.
