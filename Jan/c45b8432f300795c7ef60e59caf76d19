Maiden voyage of APT James to Trinidad and Tobago				




The much-awaited APT James ferry has officially sailed its maiden interisland voyage between Trinidad and Tobago last Thursday, January 21



An all-aluminum high-speed catamaran, APT James can accommodate 926 passengers and 250 cars. Travelling at speeds up to 37.5 knots it is expected to make the inter-island trip in approximately 3 hours.



The custom-built vessel, named after former politician Alphonso Philbert Theophilus James, features the latest ‘smart ship’ technology, which includes an advanced Motion Control System to deliver a more comfortable and stable ride for passengers and crew. 



Construction took 20 months, and cost of around US$73 million. The APT James will be the latest addition to the inter-island sea bridge. 



Prime Minister Dr the Hon Keith Rowley led the commissioning ceremony at the Port of Scarborough, Tobago.



The Prime Minister said it is a time of rejoicing for the people of Trinidad and Tobago.



“This new vessel is a major national investment and will positively contribute to the country’s economic development. And with proper care and regular maintenance, the country’s newest inter-island ferry, the APT James, should remain in operation for 30 years and beyond.”



Dr Rowley added that he is proud to name the vessel after a Tobagonian politician and visionary. 



“I’m particularly proud to name this vessel after APT James. We in Tobago should know who he is, what he stood for. What struck me as I grew up in Tobago was the representation and the singularity of purpose of a man who was ahead of his time. We are grateful for his service and we thank his family.”



Rowley then announced that another vessel built by Australian company Incat – the Buccoo Reef, has left Australia last week en route to Trinidad and Tobago.



Plaques dedicated to James were also unveiled during the commissioning.
