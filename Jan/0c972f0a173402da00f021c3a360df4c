PAHO Director commends Dominica for its COVID-19 response				




Director of Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) Dr Carissa Etienne has commended the Government of the Commonwealth of Dominica for the measures it has undertaken to curb COVID-19.



“I probably have not sufficiently complimented Dominica on the work that is has done so far in addressing the pandemic. You have made me proud. I think you have done a tremendous job.”



The PAHO Director added that apart from the government, the MInistry of health and the front line workers, the general public also played a big role in mitigating the spread of COVID-19 on the island.



Etienne called on the citizens to continue to follow COVID-19 protocols and not let their guards down.



“Take the virus seriously, do not let down your guard because this virus is very serious. Wear masks, and wear them properly. We also need to ensure social distancing, do proper hygiene and avoid congregating.”



To date, the Dominica Ministry of Health, Wellness and New Health Investment has reported 110 confirmed cases with 8 currently active and zero deaths.
