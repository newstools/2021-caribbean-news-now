974 pounds of plastic collected at first RePLAST Collection Point				




Residents from Gros Islet and its environs delivered 974 pounds of PET (Polyethylene terephthalate) and HDPE (High-density polyethylene) plastic waste to the first of three RePLAST Collection Points (RCP) to go into operation. 



From the quantity of plastics delivered, patrons earned a combined total of 365,443 RePLAST Reward points. Implementing agency of the RePLAST OECS Pilot Plastic Recycling Project, UNITE Caribbean, along with partnering agencies, Saint Lucia Solid Waste Management Authority and the Gros Islet Constituency Council have hailed the first RePLAST Collection Point (RCP) a success.



“We were very impressed with the level of support and the number of persons who came out. As a matter of fact, from 8:30 a.m. we have people lining up with many bags of bottles. We are very pleased with the turnout so far this morning.” RePLAST OECS Project Director, Shanta King, said.



In preparation for RCP operations, RePLAST-OECS is equipping each of the coordinating agencies with its own inventory of hardware and equipment, inclusive of tents, chairs, scales, signage and computers to facilitate operations. Over the past three months, the RePLAST-OECS Pilot Project and its partners have mobilized more than 100 volunteers island-wide and developed and delivered volunteer training on the operation of RCPs.



The Gros Islet RePLAST Collection Point is one of three in the northern district. The other two Collection Points for that district will be located in the areas of Monchy and Grande Riviere.



The RePLAST-OECS Project creates a sustainable model for the efficient management of plastic waste, which can be adopted in other Caribbean countries. It is primarily funded by the Republic of France on behalf of the Government of Saint Lucia and is being implemented by UNITE Caribbean.
