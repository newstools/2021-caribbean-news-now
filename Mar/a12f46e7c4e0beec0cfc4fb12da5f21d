ECCB digital currency rolls out on March 31				




Eastern Caribbean Central Bank’s (ECCB) digital currency, DCash, will commence on March 31 in Antigua and Barbuda, Grenada, St Kitts and Nevis, and St Lucia.



ECCB Governor, Timothy N. J. Antoine, announced the public roll-out of DCash through various social media platforms. 



Antoine emphasises that DCash is safer, faster and cheaper and encourages all to get on board.  



“The future of the EC Dollar is digital, so let’s make history together,” added Antoine



DCash is a securely minted digital version of the Eastern Caribbean dollar issued by the ECCB. 



It is an innovative, real-time payment option available within the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU) and offers a safer, faster, cheaper method for making payments and sending/receiving funds to and from other DCash users and merchants.  



Consumers can access DCash via the official App, the DCash Wallet, and conduct financial transactions using their smart devices. 



DCash can be obtained from participating commercial banks, credit unions or other authorised institutions.



ECCB has partnered with Bitt Inc to develop the digital EC currency. 



Speaking on the announcement, CEO of Bitt, Brian Popelka, said, “Bitt is very proud to provide the ECCB with our full stack of digital currency management systems to enhance the financial services within their member countries. The past two years of this partnership have developed from intense consultations between the Bitt team and the ECCB to our team supporting the ECCB.”



The DCash pilot aims to create greater financial inclusion in the ECCU as well as increase economic growth and business opportunities.
