The Queen has returned to royal duties				




The Queen has returned to royal duties, just a few days after the death of HRH The Duke of Edinburgh, to mark the retirement of the Earl Peel, her household’s most senior official.



Queen Elizabeth II held her first in-person ceremony yesterday, in which the Earl Peel formally stood down as Lord Chamberlain.



During a ceremony held at Windsor Castle, the Queen accepted her former royal aide’s wand and insignia of office.



“The Earl Peel had an audience of The Queen today, delivered up his Wand and Insignia of Office as Lord Chamberlain and the Badge of Chancellor of the Royal Victorian Order and took leave upon relinquishing his appointment as Lord Chamberlain when Her Majesty invested him with the Royal Victorian Chain.” as recorded in the Court Circular – a daily list of the events attended by the Queen and her family.



The Queen recently conferred a prestigious honour on the Earl Peel, making him a Permanent Lord in Waiting.



Andrew Parker, a former MI5 chief, took up the new role on April 1, following the Earl Peel’s retirement after more than 14 years in the post.



Before the Earl Peel stepped down from his position, he had overseen arrangements for Operation Forth Bridge – the duke’s funeral.



The Lord Chamberlain oversees all senior appointments in the household, is the channel of communication between the sovereign and the House of Lords and ensures coordination between Buckingham Palace and Clarence House.
