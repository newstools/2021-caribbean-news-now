Barbados Minister of Tourism and International Transport, Lisa Cummins described the milestone as a major boost for the country’s tourism. 



“We look forward to welcoming KLM once more, two decades later, to our shores. As we look at the state of the global tourism industry, the fact that in the midst of this pandemic, our partners continue to demonstrate such confidence in the Barbados brand, with KLM adding approximately 20,000 seats from Europe to Barbados over five months, is heartwarming.”



BTMI’s Director for Europe, Anita Nightingale, noted that the new partnership with KLM is very special.



“KLM is special because it was the very first airline that arrived in Barbados back in 1938. The Dutch are equally excited about returning to the island as shown by the 180 plus arrivals today.”



As one of the longest-running airlines in the world, and operating under its original name for 100 years, KLM is the largest long-haul carrier from Europe, serving 318 destinations in 118 countries with 80 codeshare partners. 



KLM Flights will operate non-stop from Amsterdam to Barbados, three days a week – Monday, Thursday, and Saturday on KLM’s modern, efficient fleet of Airbus A330-200.



Flights will depart Amsterdam at 12:25 p.m. CET and will arrive in BGI at 4:45 p.m. AST, the service will run until March 31st, 2022.
