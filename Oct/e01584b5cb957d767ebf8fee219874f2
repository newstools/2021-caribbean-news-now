SVG’s Sydney Marie engine severely damaged by fire				




The engine of MV Sydney Marie, owned by Odin’s Trading from St Vincent, was badly damaged by fire while in Guyana.



The Guyana Fire Service (GFS) said they received an alert that a vessel is on fire at Gafoors Complex, Land of Canaan, East Bank Demerara at 3:31 am Tuesday morning. Authorities confirmed that the fire came from the vessel’s generator room.



“The cause of the fire was determined as overheating of a generator in the forepeak of the ship which resulted in arcing and sparking. The generator was severely damaged and a quantity of rope was destroyed as a result of the fire.”



MV Sydney Marie, bearing IMO number 7432317 and official number 400913, is used for aggregate transport. The vessel was built in 1976 and currently sailing under the flag of St Vincent & Grenadines.



Captained Richard Bynoe said that no crew was injured.



Firefighters were able to contain the fire to the generator room thereby averting the loss of the vessel.



The GFS has reminded sea-farers to be wary of several measures that could be taken to prevent accidental fires on board.
