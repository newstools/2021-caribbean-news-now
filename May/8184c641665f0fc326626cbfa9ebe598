CARICOM congratulates Guyana on its independence anniversary				




CARICOM Secretary-General, Ambassador Irwin LaRocque, congratulates Guyana on the occasion of its 55th Independence Anniversary. Full statement as follows:



“On behalf of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), I extend congratulations to the Government and People of the Cooperative Republic of Guyana on the occasion of the country’s Fifty-fifth Anniversary of Independence on 26 May 2021.



Guyana has progressed markedly since becoming a nation. Guyanese have made their mark globally in diplomacy, the arts, academia and sport.



A valued member of the Caribbean Community from its inception, Guyana has played a pivotal role in shaping our regional integration movement. In addition, being host of the Headquarters of the CARICOM Secretariat confers both a symbolic and a physical dimension to the centrality of its role.



Mr. President, the Community looks forward to Guyana’s continued contributions, especially in your capacity as the Lead Head of Government with responsibility for Agriculture and Food Security in the Quasi Cabinet of the Conference of Heads of Government. Those priority areas have taken on increased importance under your leadership, as the Community seeks to address and recover from the devastating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.



Excellency, the Caribbean Community pledges its continued support and commitment to the People and Government of Guyana, especially in relation to the preservation of the country’s territorial integrity.



We extend our best wishes for the prosperity and security of Guyana on this momentous occasion and beyond.”
