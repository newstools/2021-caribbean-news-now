Royal Caribbean gets green light to cruise in June				




After more than a year when borders were closed globally to contain the spread of the SARS-CoV-2, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has given its approval to Celebrity Cruises, a wholly owned subsidiary of Royal Caribbean Group, to begin sailing again in June.



“We’re making history today!” Celebrity Cruises announced on Twitter Thursday. “After receiving the green light from the CDC, #CelebrityEdge will set sail from Fort Lauderdale on June 26, making her the first ship to sail US waters once again.”



Both the CDC and the cruise industry agreed on resuming sailing by mid-summer, according to a Reuters report.



Instead of a simulated voyage, which was one of the requirements of the CDC before cruise lines resume sailing, the crew and passengers of Celebrity Cruises are to be vaccinated.

Celebrity Cruises choosing the vaccination route would involve submitting an attestation to the CDC, which states “that 95% of crew (excluding any newly embarking crew in quarantine) are fully vaccinated and submit to CDC a clear and specific vaccination plan and timeline to limit cruise ship sailings to 95% of passengers who have been verified by the cruise ship operator as fully vaccinated prior to sailing.”



Sailings will depart with vaccinated crew and everyone over 16 must present proof of vaccination against COVID-19. “From August 1, all guests ages 12 and older must present proof of vaccination,” reported Reuters.



As of May 2, 2020, over 40 cruise ships have had confirmed positive cases of coronavirus on board.
