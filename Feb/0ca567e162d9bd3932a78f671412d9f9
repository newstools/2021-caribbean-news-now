St Lucia poster essay and spoken word poetry contest				







Press Release – Friends of Saint Lucia International, a UK based charity is delighted to introduce its inaugural Peace & Love Poster, Essay and Spoken Word Poetry Contest. The spoken word is divided into 2 categories – English & Kwéyòl.

The Contest is open to all Saint Lucian-based young adults between the ages of 12 to 14 on February 1st, 2022, that are in school or youth/community groups.

The Peace & Love Contest is a project we hope will provide an opportunity to challenge the minds of our young people in expressing their creative writing, poetic and drawing skills whilst raising aspirations, widening participation and promoting Peace and Love.
The Contest was conceived as a means of finding a meaningful way to engage our young people in a time when mental health issues are on the increase, exacerbated by the COVID-19 Pandemic.
And at the same time, rewarding their creativity through the expression of Peace & Love within the theme.
The Contest was also seen as a way of beginning a lifelong relationship with local schools and the wider community as we pursue our mission of becoming the largest International Voluntary Organisation serving Saint Lucia.
We hope too, that the Contest becomes an annual event and spur on other initiatives that would benefit and continue to challenge our young people, in the hope of increasing their preparedness to become our leaders.
Prizes for each category are as follows: Winner EC$1000.00, 1st runner upEC$500.00 & 2nd runner up EC$250.00. Plus 3 commendation prizes of EC$100.00.
It is hoped that this contest will become an annual event as part of our Anniversary of Independence Celebrations.
The contest dates are from February 22nd to October 22nd, 2021.
