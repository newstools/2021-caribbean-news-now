Dominica on lockdown as COVID-19 cases spike				




The Government of Dominica has imposed a weekend lockdown as COVID-19 cases continue to spike. Latest statistics show there are 158 active cases on the island – most of which are unvaccinated.



The absolute curfew commenced at 6:00 pm last Friday, August 6th, 2021 and will be in effect until Monday, August 9th, 2021 at 5:00 am. 



Only essential workers, taxi drivers, people seeking medical attention and persons travelling in and out of the country are free to operate during curfew hours.



Gas stations at High Street, Portsmouth, Canfield and Marigot are open, until 1:00 pm. Only taxi operators and essential workers will be served.



Pharmacies are opened from 10:00 am to 1:00 pm.



Supermarkets and shops open from 10:00 am to 1:00 pm. But the government has urged Dominicans to “only shop where you reside.”  Skerrit made it clear that you only will be allowed to shop where you reside. For example, people from Mahaut will be allowed to shop only in Mahaut and not in the neighbouring village of Massacre. 



In an address to the nation, Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit said that while some people are following the protocols, most people fail to comply to the COVID-19 restrictions. 



 “We remind all residents to remain vigilant and adhere to the COVID-19 protocols. The Government cannot contain the spread of this disease all by itself. Every resident must cooperate and act responsibly”. 



Dominicans are likewise encouraged to take the vaccine to help curb the spread.



Meanwhile, the government is conducting free testing over the weekend at the following locations:
