Usain Bolt introduced twin sons				




With three lightning bolt emojis for each of his children, all-time Olympic great sprinter Usain Bolt introduced to the world his twin sons in an Instagram post on Father’s Day.



The Jamaican track and field legend posted a family photo, with Bolt sitting next to his partner Kasi Bennett, their daughter Olympia Lightning and the newborn twins.



Like their sister, the boys have been given equally fitting names — Thunder and Saint Leo. 



Bennett also posted photos of the family with the caption: “Happy Father’s Day to my forever love! @usainbolt. You are the rock of this family and the greatest daddy to our little ones. We love you world without end!”



Bolt won eight gold medals at the 2008, 2012 and 2016 Games and the only sprinter to win the 100m and 200m double at three consecutive Olympics.



Since his retirement in 2017, Bolt now has a number of business interests, including an electric scooter company – also called Bolt.
