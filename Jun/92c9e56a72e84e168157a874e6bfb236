Meghan and Harry welcome ‘Lili’				




Prince Harry and Meghan paid tribute to the Queen and the late Princess Diana by naming their second child, Lilibet “Lili” Diana Mountbatten-Windsor.



Lili was born Friday at 11:40 a.m. at the Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital in Santa Barbara, California, and weighed in at 7 lbs, 11 oz.



She is eighth in line to the British throne.



Lilibet is the family nickname of Queen Elizabeth II.



Harry and Meghan shared intimate thoughts on baby Lili via their Archewell Foundation website.



“On June 4th, we were blessed with the arrival of our daughter, Lili. She is more than we could have ever imagined, and we remain grateful for the love and prayers we’ve felt from across the globe. Thank you for your continued kindness and support during this very special time for our family.”



No photos of the newborn or the Sussexes accompanied the announcement. 



The couple has said that in lieu of gifts, they request those interested learn about or support nonprofit organizations working for women and girls, including Girls Inc., Harvest Home, CAMFED or Myna Mahila Foundation.



Queen Elizabeth and the royal family shared their delight over the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s news in a statement.



“The Queen, The Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall, and The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have been informed and are delighted with the news of the birth of a daughter for The Duke and Duchess of Sussex.”



Despite stepping down from his royal duties, Harry’s place in the order of succession to the throne remains.



The first seven places remain unchanged: Prince Charles; Prince William; William’s children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis; Prince Harry, and his son, Archie.



Lilibet’s birth moves Prince Andrew, who was born second in line in 1960, down to ninth place.
