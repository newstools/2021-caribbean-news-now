Bajans will head to the polls on January 19				




Bajans will head to the polls to elect a Government to lead them for the next five years on January 19, 2022.



The next general election is more than a year before it is constitutionally due.



In an announcement to the nation from llaro Court, Prime Minister Mia Amor Mottley said that the Nomination Day would be on January 3.



“On this the 27th day of December 2021, I have decided that it would be in the interest of Barbados, our country, our home that we recalibrate as a people behind one Government and one leader.  Let me say that whoever emerges as that leader I will support.  I will do my utmost to promote the interest of Barbados and Barbadians in all that I say and do, as I have done in all of my public careers and would continue to do until the Lord takes my breath.”



Mottley shared that she had met earlier in the day with the President of Barbados, Dame Sandra Mason, and had advised that Parliament be dissolved with immediate effect.



The Prime Minister added that Dame Sandra had also been advised to issue writs for the “holding of new elections in Barbados”.



Mottley disclosed that she would be advising officials from the Electoral and Boundaries Commission and the COVID-19 Cabinet Sub-Committee to meet on the structure of the voting process in light of the ongoing pandemic.



In the last general elections held here on May 24, 2018, Mottley led the Barbados Labour Party (BLP) to a commanding victory over the then ruling Democratic Labour Party (DLP)  sweeping all 30 seats in the Parliament.
