BVI Emancipation Day 2021				




To ensure that people continue to remain safe during COVID-19, the British Virgin Islands (BVI) will commemorate Emancipation Day 2021 virtually. 



Deputy Premier and Minister for Education, Culture, Youth Affairs, Fisheries and Agriculture, Dr. the Honourable Natalio D. Wheatley, said this year’s service will reflect their ancestral history and emancipation story.  In addition, a special remembrance will be held for those who have lost their lives to the COVID-19 virus.



“Now more than ever, the Virgin Islands must continue to unite in the strength of prayer and purpose. We must continue to remember the strength of our ancestors and foreparents who, like us, went through similar experiences and they always came together, unified for the Virgin Islands, and our action must be no different.”  



The annual Emancipation Service will be held on the first Sunday in August. There will also be tributes and presentations from various churches as well as original pieces from the Virgin Islands Poet Laureate, Dr. Richard Georges; writer and researcher, Eugenia O’Neal and singer/songwriter, Mr. Jovan Cline.



The sermon for the day will be given by Senior Pastor of the Cane Garden Bay Baptist Church and Chairman of the Virgin Islands Heritage Month Committee, Reverend Dr. Melvin A. Turnbull.



Director for Culture, Dr. Katherine Smith said, “It was heartwarming to witness the spirit of compassion with which the churches and participants in our virtual Emancipation Service 2021 are giving of their time and talents.”



The public is invited to tune in to the Emancipation Service on Sunday, August 1 at 3:00 p.m. The service will be streamed on the Government of the Virgin Islands’ Facebook page and ZBVI Radio.



The Emancipation Service which celebrates freedom from colonialism and slavery through prayer and worship is held every year on the first Sunday in August.
