Bahamas’ FNM elects new leader				




Bahamas’ Free National Movement (FNM) elects its new party leader during the one-day leadership convention at the holy Trinity Activities Centre.



Delegates and party supporters gathered to see which of the three Grand Bahama MPs would be chosen to lead the party after voting officially closed at 2:13 pm.



Marco City MP Michael Pintard defeated East Grand Bahama MP Kwasi Thompson and Central Grand Bahama MP Iram Lewis with 297 votes which were 67 per cent of the votes cast. 



In his acceptance speech, Pintard said he will work to unite the party.



“I am humbled by the trust and confidence that you have placed in me. I commit to dedicate myself every day to working tirelessly on behalf of all of you and to listen to you and collaborate with you. Our collective genius is always better than a single-minded focus of an ‘A’ leader or a small group of leaders. We need all of you.”



Pintard also reached out to party members who left, asking them to “return home”.



“We are asking you to return to the organization that you built, so we can be even better than we are now.”



Outgoing FNM leader, Dr Hubert Minnis was not present when the results were announced but said he will support whoever emerges as the winner from the leadership race.



Minnis said that he is an FNM first and will remain one, adding that he knows it is the best government for the country. 



The FNM plans to hold a full convention with all other leadership positions open for contest in February 2022.
