Dominica strengthens bilateral ties with China				




The Commonwealth of Dominica has signed a visa-waiver agreement with the People’s Republic of China, strengthening the bilateral ties between the two countries.



Dominica Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit and Chinese Ambassador to Dominica Lin Xianjiang signed the agreement in a ceremony held yesterday, November 22 in the presence of several other officials from both countries.



Prime Minister Skerrit thanked the Chinese government for yet another significant milestone achieved and reaffirmed Dominica’s pledge in the reunification of China.



“We thank the People’s Republic of China for its friendship, cooperation and trust over the years, and we reaffirm our commitment to the One China Policy”. 



Xianjiang noted he hopes that the agreement will increase travel from country to country.



“We make this special arrangement for Dominica because we see Dominica as a very important friend to us, and we want to pish our bilateral relations to a new height. I wish that with this agreement coming to an effect, the people to people exchange can be made closer.”



The signing ceremony also marks the first official duty of Lin Xianjiang as Chinese Ambassador to Dominica after his credentials were presented to President Charles Savarin.



It was in 2004 when China and Dominica established diplomatic relations at the ambassadorial level.



With the mutual visa exemption agreement coming to effect, ordinary Dominica passport holders will now be able to access four out of the world’s six biggest economies visa-free. The agreement is also projected to further boost Dominica’s CBI Programme.
